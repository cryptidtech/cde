# Cryptographic Data Encoding (CDE)

This is an implementation of the [CDE specification](https://github.com/cryptidtech/cryptographic-data-encoding/blob/main/cryptographic-data-encoding.md).

It supports encoding and decoding cryptographic data into either a text or
binary encoding with a type tag that specifies the class, sub-class, and sub-
sub-class along with the length of the data.
